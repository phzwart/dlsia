"""
Modules containing popular loss functions suitable for image 
segmentation. These loss functions provide varying metrics for judging 
overall network error and performance, a few of which are simple 
averages of others. Additionally, these loss functions leverage torch.nn  
backend functions and are compatible  with GPU implementation and 
Pytorch autograd gradient calculation.

Though this set of functions is intended for binary image segmentation 
of single classes, it acts as a template for averaging multiple classes.

Overviews of these loss functions are detailed in:
